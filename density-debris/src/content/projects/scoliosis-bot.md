This project was born out of my desire to avoid developing back pain in the future. During the pandemic, I was constantly staring at a computer screen since all of my courses were virtual. I figured I might as well spend some time developing a bot that would remind me at random intervals of time in the day to take a break from staring at a computer screen. 

# How I did it

The bot was primarily built from `Discord.js` (version 12). To set it up, I had to install `Node.js` and coded it using `JavaScript`. It was my first time working with event-driven programming, and it was unlike my prior coding experiences. I had a lot of fun working on it and learned a lot given that it was one of the very first programming projects that I had ever worked on. 

More details can be found in the GitHub repository where I list out instructions for how to host the bot locally if you wished.
