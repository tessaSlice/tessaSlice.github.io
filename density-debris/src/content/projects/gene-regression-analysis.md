In my junior year of high school, I joined a club who were pursuing several research projects involving links between genes and diseases. 

Although I had no background knowledge in genes or RNA sequencing, I was interested in seeing how applications of programming, ML in particular, could potentially reduce the cost of performing a medical procedure. 

# How I did it

This project was the first time that I got the opportunity to learn how to do data analysis with python. I learned how to set up a jupyter notebook and then wrote some code that would be able to interact with the data website's API that would allow us to collect some crucial data and stored it in a text file. 

Upon obtaining the data, I wrangled the data using standard data analysis libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy`. After the data was in the desired format, I experimented around with multiple regression models using `skikit-learn` such as random forest and partial least squares. After I created the models, I then proceeded to analyze the models on multiple metrics, such as the root means squared.
