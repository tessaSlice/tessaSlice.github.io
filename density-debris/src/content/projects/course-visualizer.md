Through taking EECS 281, Data Structures & Algorithms, I gained a newfound appreciation for a variety of data structures besides the wonderful vector. 

As I advance further into my education at U-M, I've realized that there's a limited amount of courses I can take but a seemingly unlimited amount of offerings that are extremely enticing. There's a massive trove of courses offered at U-M and I wanted there to exist some method to display the courses and their prerequisites properly. 

Then I realized that the connections between courses can be represented in a directed graph, and that was the motivation for my desire to build this project. 

# How I did it

It's a full stack project that I created from scratch. The front end is composed of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The back end is made of C++ and Pistache. [TODO add more details - WIP]
