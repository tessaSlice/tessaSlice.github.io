# Inspiration

Traveling is rewarding; however, planning can be stressful. Many plans their trip with a travel agency due to convenience, while others choose to plan online because of flexibility. TrekTician gives a one-stop tour planner that generates all aspects of your travel plan tailored to your preferences, which provides BOTH convenience and flexibility.

# How we did it

This was a massive team effort, and I primarily worked on the backend aspect of the project. To make the backend, I used Flask and python. We used the python requests library to make GEMINI API calls and to retrieve images of the cities from the Google custom search engine API. 

Other team members focused on working in the front-end, and more details on their work and documentation can be found in the GitHub repository or through the Devpost link below.
