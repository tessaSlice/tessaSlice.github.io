This is a project I did with other high school students for SpartaHack 8, a hackathon hosted at Michigan State University. 

Tools evolve, whether to improve security, increase ergonomics, or become more efficient. When the walking caneâ€™s color was changed from black to white, safety increased as the canes became more visible to motorists as users crossed the street. However, many flaws of the white cane, including limited detection and obtrusiveness, have yet to be addressed. This is where the Wireless Walker gets the spotlight.

# How we did it

From the beginning, our team wished to leverage our skills with Arduino microcontrollers and their associated sensors. Understanding that, using data collection with said sensors was a major priority of the team even before considering the idea of the ultrasonic sensor walking stick. As SpartaHacks began, we discussed our options as a team before rushing to the hardware room as it became clear the demand of our project would require more parts, and in particular certain specific parts (such as the ultrasonic sensor and a functioning servo) than many other Hacks.

We then split up into a few sub-groups, each focusing on a particular task such as having the ultrasonic sensor function, the servo the sensor would be mounted on spin, and operating communications between the front and back-ends of the product.
