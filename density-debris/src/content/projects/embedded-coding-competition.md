During the summer of 2023, Nexteer hosted an embedded systems competition for students who lived in the region. I took this as an opportunity to learn more about how to use Arduinos. The competition theme was cracking a series of challenges, which would eventually crack open a lock and students would be awarded points. Nexteer also hosted the inaugural embedded coding competition the year prior, which I had also participated in and is what really spawned my knowledge of Arduino. 

# How I did it

I used an Arduino kit generously provided by the competition organizers. Through participating in the two competitions I used a myriad of devices: a LCD screen, buzzer, stepper motor (and accompanying motoro driver), and a Bluetooth Low Energy sensor. I connected these devices together using some wires provided in the kit and the breadboard.
