# Inspiration

In high schoool, my computer science teacher challenged my class to create a game and then implement an AI algorithm. I chose Tetris. I implemented a genetic algorithm, but unfortunately the parameters are not tuned very well so the decisions made by the algorithm are effectively random. 

This was undoubtedly the biggest CS project I had done up to that point, spanning across multiple files. I always look back at this project fondly to remember har far I've progressed in my programming skills since then. 

# How I did it

It's entirely made of Java. I used standard Java libraries such as `java.awt.Color`, `java.awt.Font`, `java.awt.Graphics`, `java.awt.Point` to create my Tetris display. I also developed a strong appreciation for `ArrayList`s.
